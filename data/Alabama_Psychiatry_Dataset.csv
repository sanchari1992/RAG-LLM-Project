Iliana Lopez,5,2024,"I would like to share my experience and so far my experience is all been positive. The process was very simple to get started. I felt a lot of compassion, understanding and empathy from all staff. I’ll be honest I was very afraid to take that first step, but I did it the doctors I have spoken to Have been very Professional and very helpful. I’m just starting my process to getting my life back. The only regret I have is not doing this sooner."
Rodney Smith,1,2024,"I wanted to tell my experience since being seen at this establishment. I recently found out that my therapist allowed for someone to 'listen in"" on my appointment without my knowledge at the time, nor my consent. This person that they allowed is a disgruntled manager that I work with who some how was able to get in this therapist ear and was able to convince her to have her eavesdrop on my appointment. Im guessing that they may know each other. I literally had a fellow employee *rat* her out by telling me EVERYTHING that was discussed in my appointment that they wouldn't know otherwise. Safe to say the confidentiality is nonexistent at this place."
Mellanie Herard,4,2024,"I would love to give Dr. Whitt 5 stars if this rating was solely based on my appointment with her. However, I will not be having any future appointments with Dr. Rabbani."
Chelsea Jordan,1,2024,"As a long-standing client of this practice, I must express my deep concern regarding recent changes in management and billing practices. While Ceceila has been an exceptional therapist, the overall management of the practice has left me feeling concerned. Despite multiple assurances from my insurance company that my appointments have been paid, I have been repeatedly told otherwise by the office manager. The recent demand for payment of $1,742, despite claims being paid, (I have the Explanation of benefits(EOB) is troubling. As a practice manager myself, I recognize the seriousness of mishandling billing and urge swift resolution before further complications arise."
Tom Kost,1,2024,"This office is incompetent. Both Dr. Whitt and Dr. Rabbani missed telehealth appointments in the same month, because the office did not correctly link advance payment with the appointments. In both cases, I was on the telehealth session in an empty room for 30 minutes, because no one told me the doctors would not be present for the appointments. When I was able to successfully make contact with the office I was told I “would not be charged a no-show fee.” No apology was given. The office worker by the name of Madonna actually reprimanded and hung up on me. Because of their inconsistency to that point I contacted the office to confirm two appointments for April but was advised that the appointments were cancelled with no reason or notice given. Of the eight appointments scheduled with this office, four of them were either missed by the doctors or cancelled without notice. Dr. Whitt was great. I just will not continue to work with the office."
Adriana Watson-Hankins,5,2024,Updated review previously had an issue with billing but thankfully they called and explained everything for me and we worked out a mutual agreement. I do like Dr. Rabbani as my Dr . I have been a patient of his for a few years . I had been struggling with depression but thankfully he got me the right medication and therapy and most of the time I am a happy go lucky person thanks to him.
Richard Finke,5,2024,Dr rabbani is the best Dr I've been too he really listened to my needs took his time adressed them fully on the spot started a treatment plan I now finally feel like I can be myself again. the staff are so amazing to I have had my children here for counseling as well I highly recommend cecilia watts. she will listen to every detail and help you with anything you need to get you to where you need to be they go above and beyond
Tammy Smith,1,2024,"The new person in the office, Ateeya Rabanni Charged my debit card $82 & $479 at 7:18pm on 3/18/2024 without my consent, permission or authorization. The office had not billed my insurance yet. I paid $200 in copays and coinsurance 2 weeks earlier. I called amd asked for my my card information be removed from their system immediately and was assured that it was. I was told by another person in the office that when a person makes a payment over the phone she keeps all card numbers written down in her desk and will do this often after hours and that if the charges were reversed she would use the numbers she had written down and go back into the system and resubmit it.This is credit card fraud and theft. Beware if she has your bank or credit card information. Edit to reply to your response: Your response is a blatant lie. If you didnt have my card number how did you charge me without permission? You kept the card numbers written down, that's how. I can show proof of $200 being paid to your office, 2 weeks prior to your theft, to cover copays and anticipated coinsurance. There were no payment arrangements because your own staff said the insurance had not been billed yet. We discussed checking back in a month to see what was happening with the insurance. You act like 2023 was a long time ago. It was 3 months before you stole from my bank account. I NEVER signed anything or gave you verbal permission to charge my card for anything other than the $200. The same staff member told me about the card numbers being kept in a desk drawer. The same staff member that suggested I press charges because this is being done on a regular basis, causing peoples checking accounts to be over drawn, which causes them financial hardship. The same person that gave me the full name of the person that committed the fraud and said she was either the new ceo or thought she was. What you did was illegal and immoral. Edit: Now I'm getting calls from your office trying to justify what you did. Telling me that once I allowed you to use my card once you have permission to use it whenever you want to. Told me I signed a paper stating this. I asked for a copy of that signature because it 100% will not be mine. Now I'm being told it was an electronic signature, lol. Ok"
Blakeley Mann,1,2024,"I am very frustrated with my experience. Prior to running out of my prescription, I attempted to call the office numerous times over the span of several days. Eventually, I was able to get in touch with someone and was told they would let the doctor know I was in need of a refill. In the following days after, I attempted to get an update on the prescription, because I was beginning to experience withdrawals. I still could not get in touch with anyone by phone. I was eventually able to get in touch with the office via email. Their responses were unprofessional and made me feel as if I was being irrational for following up on the prescription. I informed them that I attempted to call the office multiple times on separate days. They stated that they attempted to call me back several times but kept getting my voicemail - this never occurred as I did not have any missed calls or voicemails from them. This seems to be a common theme based on other reviews I have read. After several days, I eventually had to contact my family doctor in order receive my prescription. I cannot in good conscience recommend this office to anyone seeking assistance with their mental health."
Amelia Briggs,1,2024,"I just had the worst experience of my life with a psychiatrist. i’ve never had someone be so aggressive and judgemental. he refused to prescribe me Klonopin even though i’d be happy to drug test, have no drug abuse history, and have been prescribed that by a previous psychiatrist because he doesn’t believe in that class of drugs. He was basically yelling at me and cutting me off the entire last half of the appointment saying he will not prescribe that and wanting to put me on sssris which i have already taken and make me sick. I imagine he has never experienced what it is like to have a panic attack, because if he had he wouldn’t have been so harsh with me asking for something I already know helps me and works for me. Horrible bedside manner. i’ve never called to ask for a refund from an appointment, but i left that appointment feeling 10x worse than I did before. He should not be handling people with anxiety and depression because he made me feel judged for knowing what i do and do not like in medications. So sorry Dr. Rabbani that i don’t want to take an SSRI that makes me nauseous and hot all the time to then STILL have panic attacks. Sorry Klonopin is the only thing that has helped during a panic attack- i know that doesn’t fit in with your standards.. Seriously protect yourself from this place. update also in response to their response below- no one ever called me. when i made this complaint the receptionist laughed at me saying that no one has ever had a problem like i did and told me she would let me know about a refund. no one called me yesterday to check on how i was or update me on getting a refund. it’s crazy that you’ve never heard this before since you’re rating is 2.8 on google with tons of reviews just like this one…"
Lizzie Hudson,3,2024,"I posted earlier regarding the lack of communication with this office following my several voicemails and emails in an attempt to reschedule an appointment. I was contacted today by their management, and did secure an appointment immediately. I appreciated this quick response. I do hope that the office improves its communication and information services to clients, as the experience was highly frustrating."
Brandy Hopkins,1,2023,"It really pains me to leave this review. I was so excited to use this office. When I called they got my daughter in so quickly. However, things quickly turned badly because of front desk office or admin. They couldn't get our insurance right and demanded payment on her first visit, even though my daughter had three free visits. They then called later and admitted they were wrong and she did infact have the three free visits. They later set an appointment, we never got a link. We called the office and no one answered. I left a voice mail. We were charged an MA (missed appt fee) ..then apparently set her up with an appointment and never bothered to tell me or my daughter and charged us a second MA fee. When I approached the front office and advised of what happened they said only the doctor could waive the MA Fee's....which he refused to do. I advised this office I am a single mother, these charges are erroneous as it is! I cannot afford these extra charges. This office cares less about people and more about money. They are willing to let my daughter go without her much needed medication over made up charges, they refuse to fix. The lady I spoke to was rude, and even asked my daughter if we accused her of lying because of the charges. I can honestly say we attempted the visit, called the office, and tried to work things out. If mental health was paramount to this office, I would not be writing this review. Mental health is too important to play with. Madonna has an awful attitude."
Livia Cornella,1,2023,"If possible I would give them zero stars. My last three appointments with this office, they never sent me a link to join the calls and still charged me saying it was my fault for a “no show.” Every time after that, they hang up on me when I’m calling, refuse to give me a voicemail. Not to mention the amount of money I had to pay out of pocket for my prescription because they told me they called my insurance to authorize it and never did. I’ve been trying to get my records from them for almost 2 years and they still won’t give them to me. I don’t recommend this place unless you want your depression to worsen and feel absolutely hopeless. I’ve never felt so used for money and treated like garbage from a place that’s supposed to “help” your mental health. Sandy was always rude to me and my mother, Dr Robini only talked to me for 2-3 minutes each session and would just continue my medication even after explaining to him It’s not helping me like it did 3-4 years ago when I was first prescribed it. The only good encounter I had here was with Ms Watt’s and I haven’t been able to get in touch with her since they ghosted me. Do not recommend- AT ALL."
Nicole Castello,1,2024,"I was referred to Dr. Rabbani by my PCP to re- diagnose my ADHD. I have a previous diagnosis already and have in the past been on medication for several years, but because I chose not take medication while attempting to have more children I needed to be reevaluated. After a few weeks from when my doctor sent the referral, I ended up calling myself to get an appointment strangely enough they picked up on the first ring, scheduled my appointment they were able to accommodate my schedule and do a telehealth appointment (which the doctor never joined the room) I did my paperwork I paid my co-pay. My appointment was to be at 11:15 via room link. Instead, I received a phone call at roughly 10Am (which I had not accommodated for - so my work was interrupted) not only was the phone call dropped after speaking with Dr. Rabbani roughly 3 min - he did not call back for almost 20 min. So again my work suffered- on the second phone call attempt. He spoke with me for less than four minutes. Ask me some very strange questions told me I had to go by his office. Take a drug test, fill out a sheet of paper. And he would get back with me in a week or two. I did what I was told. But when I got to the office is was locked and the lady who opened it was nice but she was In Her socks… It’s been over a month I’ve tried calling several times - having to leave voicemails with no call backs - I attempted reaching them through the portal I was made to sign up for. My PCP has tried contacting them several times with no luck. And to make it worse I received a 900$ bill for the drug test!!! Plus a 13$ bill for (urine screening????) I have fantastic insurance. There is no reason for a bill like this. And I can not get ahold of anyone to discuss what it was for. This is just highly disappointing. I just want answers. And my time is JUST AS IMPORTANT as the Drs."
Jenna Bowen,1,2023,"I have been using this office for nearly 5 years. Dr. Whitt is incredible and has been a major help for me; however, the patient care and customer service outside of her has DRASTICALLY declined since I started going. Just within the past 2 weeks, I have had MULTIPLE phone calls sent to voicemail and not returned. Dr. Rabanni refused to refill medication before our next appointment (which was already scheduled), causing me to suffer severe withdrawals. When he finally did refill it, he did so 3 days before my appointment and sent it to the wrong pharmacy. FIVE MINUTES before our appointment, his office called me and told me he was ill and wanted to reschedule. It has been an exhausting wild goose chase to try and get simple medication, reach the office, and receive basic patient care. I will be finding another doctor because this treatment has been unacceptable."
Lisa Ann Wooten,1,2023,"I’m completely done! For several years, I have dealt with the staff being rude and unprofessional. There have been multiple attempts to contact your office and the call goes to voice mail. It’s impossible to talk to someone or get a phone call returned. This is unacceptable when it causes people to run out of their medication and are unable to maintain their daily activities. It’s sad when you’re dependent on medication to function according and your health care providers seem apathy to get you the help you need."
Nicole Clements,1,2023,"This office is a nightmare! It’s basically impossible to talk to someone or get a phone call returned. This most recent time though was the last straw. Last week I left SIX messages (via their portal and VM) and still never talked to anyone. When you call you go straight to VM. This negligence is unacceptable when it causes people to run out of their medication as it can make you very very sick. I had a concern about a recently prescribed medication that my pharmacist advised against due to other meds I take and it shouldn’t have been impossible to get the dr or a NP to call back. It is your right as a patient to have your questions/concerns addressed. THANKFULLY, I was able to find a provider that saw patients on Saturdays and given that I was about 2 days from running out of meds, they got me in immediately. Biggest shocker was that unlike Dr Rabanni, she spend almost 40 minutes talking to me and listening to my concerns. So- good help is out there, unfortunately you WILL NOT find it here."
Kelli Perrelli,5,2022,Very nice and friendly staff. I love how that always answer there phone!! Some office's I've been to are bad at that. They get my insurance correct and I've never had a problem with them. Love this office and Dr. Rabbani is a wonderful tentative doctor. He really listens to me. I always feel so much better after our appointments.
A W,5,2023,"Have been seeing Dr. Rabbani for over three years. First psychiatrist that has really listened and not just defaulted to the standard protocol. After talking with me, he developed a treatment plan that has absolutely worked!!! Will continue seeing Dr. Rabbani. Three years later and am still going strong. The staff has always been helpful. Have to travel a lot for work and the staff has worked wonders to ensure that my appointments are made and adjusted when needed. Keep up the great work!!!"
Carmen Woods,1,2024,Poor communication. The staff rude. The appointments are rushed. They are not considerate. If I could give zero stars I would. Find another services that are personable and willing to help. I would never recommend.
Braden Guy,5,2023,"Alabama Psychiatry and Counseling has been an amazing place to go for my needs. The staff is kind and helpful and the process to receive the medication I need is hassle free. Dr. Rabani is wonderful! He has worked with me over the last two years to prescribe the correct dosage of the proper medicine that allows me to live my day to day life to the fullest. Thank you, Dr. Rabani and everyone else who works at Alabama Psychiatry and Counseling!"
Kate Sligh,1,2023,"It’s been almost 2 years since I met with Dr Rabbani and it’s something that still upsets me. I’m almost 30 and I do believe I struggle with something (probably in the neighborhood of ADHD). Just about everyone close to me has pointed it out and it drives my husband (who is diagnosed with ADHD) nuts. I called to make an appointment for an evaluation, was set up with Rabbani, and he basically dismissed EVERYTHING I said because I mentioned one time that I do have GAD - which im treated for. He doesn’t seem knowledgeable, or else just doesn’t care, that ADHD can present differently than just not making good grades or having behavioral issues as a kid. I’ve never felt so defeated or uncared for. I’m not out here looking for meds, I honestly don’t even want to be medicated. I just want some validation or explanation for what I’m struggling with. Something isn’t right, but he refused to listen to me and maybe believe that I know my body and mind better than he does."
Lauren Cranford,1,2022,Never send prescriptions on time. Two times in a row now my prescription hasn’t been sent in to my pharmacy so I call them and it will take days to have it refilled even after telling me they’re sending it in that day. They claim to check their prescription refill inbox multiple times a day and not to leave multiple messages but what else are you supposed to do if your request is not being fulfilled?? I’ve seen how quickly Dr Rabbani sends over prescriptions so what is the hold up and why would you punish your patients for leaving multiple messages for your mess up?
Sharon Keane,5,2023,"I have been using Alabama Psychiatry and Counseling for more years than I can remember right now. I started with Dr. Khan (whom I STILL miss my talks with terribly) and have been seeing Dr. Rabbani since her passing. I find him and the staff to be very helpful, compassionate and knowledgeable. I have recommended several people to this practice and will continue to do so."
Karen E,1,2020,"I have been trying to locate a good doctor for weeks now and it seems as everything is booked. And finally I get an appointment here with Dr. RABBANI. The reviews are correct. He went down a check list. When I showed my concern about my issue affecting my performance at work and could possibly get terminated, he could only say he can not control what the company will do based on performance. He does not believe in time off work to figure out which medication actually will work or which plan of treatment. So what did he do that was worth my hard earned money? Nothing. If anything my thoughts have gotten worse. DO NOT USE THEM!!!"
Amy Floyd,1,2022,"A year ago I would have given 5 stars for Dr. Khan, but the care (if you can call it that) you get now is disappointing at best & infuriating at worst. Dr. Rabbani does not listen. He's late to telehealth appointments & doesn't review your chart prior to ""meeting"" with you. He's condescending and rude. I leave sessions with him feeling discouraged, frustrated and devoid of hope. I'm finding a new psychiatrist now. The only bright spot to this place is Sandy the receptionist - she is always cheerful & helpful. Avoid this place if you truly care about your mental health! Dr. R should work in a research or academic environment - he does not need to be exposed to patients struggling with mental illness. Also, whoever writes responses on Google reviews is highly unprofessional. If you receive this much negative feedback, perhaps you should listen."
Tiah Skrzycki,5,2023,Wonderful experience with Alabama psychiatry and Counseling the staff is always helpful and kind. They accommodate appointment times and are always prompt at responding back. I am so glad I chose Alabama psychiatry and Counseling and would highly recommend to anyone.
MindDrift Reviews,5,2021,"This is a beautiful and highly professional area! You won't be disappointed. I've had multiple appointments and wonderful experiences here. Granted, you have many many people that are after the wrong thing when they come here and they leave extremely disappointed. The doctors and counselors here want to make you better by giving you what you need rather than what you want. It's obvious from the reviews that some people are very upset over that but it's their loss. This is a place you can trust will look out for you and take care of you to the best of their ability."
D S,5,2022,"I’ve been a Patient at AL Psych & Counseling for over 5 yrs. Originally, I saw Dr. Khan. She was a very kind and special person. Over the years, I got to know the staff. They have always been professional; and addressed any concerns promptly. These days, I see Dr. Rabbani. He’s been very attentive, and helpful. I highly recommend him."
Urielle Fortunes,1,2022,"Worst office in the state of Alabama. I would rather talk to a cat. Do NOT set an appointment. Unprofessional. You’re better off talking to a car bumper. Horrible doctors, horrible staff. Should close down office ASAP! Feel free to quote me! (-0 star rating) I put one star because they didn’t have that option."
Faith Hill,2,2023,"I love Dr Whitt 5 stars!!!! Dr Rabbani really needs to have some more empathy and more trust in his patients. He also has a habit of being 15-30 minutes late to an appointment as you can see him walking in the door straight to his office if YOU get there on time. He is a narcissist who talks over you and takes advantage of his role as a doctor. The front desk is the rudest office staff I have ever encountered. Extremely rude over the phone, unhelpful and well rude. Why is a reviewer being told to wear a mask when the staff is not themselves??? Pot calling the kettle black. I asked to leave a message for a doctor and they said insurance didn’t cover phone conversations?! WTH your a doctors office- seems to want to get paid for things that are normally regular practice. Remember HIPPA laws also provide privacy and non disclosure of anything happening or said in or at a doctor’s office. People are allowed to voice their own opinions but stating facts or perceived facts from staff or doctors is prohibited by law. Update- 2021. I have seen the constant flow of reviews and owner replies. I have also talked to other patients. I am going to leave Dr Whitt out of it- she is an angel. Not once have I ever called or been up theirewhere your front desk treated me or anyone else even with an ounce of patience, decency or respect. Not once did Dr Rabbani listen to me- not agree- listen! I’m well versed in academia, research and mental health awareness. Your doctor was not able to give medical advice on a drug he was prescribing me. Then claimed it was something else all together causing side effects. Well multiple research studies don’t lie over years and large sample sizes- and side effects aren’t always dose dependent. As a NURSE I am required to know my medications, side effects, risks, adverse affects, and how patients have responded in my clinic to them as well as what the research says. Instead of responding to people in such negative fashion or trying to be right: be humble, be patient, be kind. Stay Away! Update- 2022 My close friend has gone to Dr. Rabbani, got treatment via medication. After several appointments my friend was not listened to, put down and being talked down too. Front staff just as rude as they have always been. My friend is no longer a patient there. Also noticed all new reviews are almost exclusively 5 stars, many have a review for only Rabbani/ front desk, also many reviewers posted to his personal account and then his place of work. Many reviewers have only made two reviews total ever on Google- to his personal account and to his work account. Statistics aren’t adding up. You can catch a 🐠 fish, but you can’t make it stop smelling. The front desk is same staff, owner leaves rude reviews only to those that are negative and the unusual rate of 5 star reviews to both personal/ work account in past 4 months is fishy."
Ken Lowery,1,2021,"First I want to start by saying that my daughter has not met with the Dr.. The first appointment after filling out tons of paperwork online and submitting it with screen shots of it saying paperwork was submitted and received somehow through a tech issue from what I was told on their end they did not receive it and we had to reschedule the appointment. Ok aggravating but it happens. So, a week later and submitting the paperwork again I get a phone call they need my DL and copy of insurance card. So I submitted that as well. I received a phone call and voice mail from the Dr. Office and returned the call but had to leave a message because no one answered. I assume with no returned call they have everything they need and my daughter checks out from school because the appointment was a 3pm and she had to be able to answer her phone in a quite place. I get home from work only to learn that no one has called. I call and get unknown person answer the phone and began to explain no one has called my daughter for her appointment. Before I can even explain who I am or who I am calling about the women on the phone apparently knows my phone number and matches me to my daughters account. She immediately goes on the defense that she called me and I did not call back. I asked the phone number that she contacted and she gave me a number that was on the account but not the number I left in the voice mail. The number she called was my wifes that can not answer phones while at work. I then explained I talked to lady by the name of ________ and she informed me that she only worked a half of a day and that she works remotely from home. Well, How was I supposed to know this? When people call they dont know where they are talking to someone and if the employee ask you to call them it would be very nice to let the customer know that they will be out of the office after a certain time and to call the main office. Apparently the phone roll to whom ever and wherever without the customer ever knowing. Yes, I am aggravated at the situation and asked the person at the office to please understand my aggravation. Well, she acted like she did not care and was only concerned about re-booking the appointment. I asked was there a Manager to talk to about my concerns and she said there was not one and that the Dr. was the only one I charge. Which Dr? I dont even know which Dr. would be calling for the appointment. I asked could she leave a message for the Dr. to call me about my situation and explain my concerns about how things have been handled just so he or she is aware of the front end and customer concerns. I felt he or she would be happy to listen and make the customer feel better about using their practice since the person answering phone calls seems to have no concern what so every other than you being a number and rescheduling the appointment. Surely someone up there does customer care and relations? After asking to leave a message to the Dr. to call regarding my issues and explaining I guess a google review might help with my concerns I was told I was being threatening and she said she was hanging up a and did so. All I wanted was to express the frustration it has been under the circumstances of a VIrtual world we live in and unformiluar charted territory. I did make the appointment in hopes that the Dr. will be better than the front end service. I hope this helps clear things up for new patients/customers and for the practice."
Diane Natale,1,2022,"I was looking for a psychiatrist for my grandson. I am stunned at how unprofessional this office staff behaves. Have they ever heard of ""Hippa""? Thanks for all the reviews and I will run from this place. I have never read so many negative reviews for a group of physicians and not one time did the staff apologize. Seems like the staff is in attack mode if someone has a legitimate complaint. I am so glad that people give reviews because it saves me so much time."
Hadija O.,5,2023,The staff is extremely friendly. Dr. Rabanni takes time to actual listen to your needs and develop a plan that works. I have never had a issue with scheduling or payments.
C Nation,1,2021,"Scheduled an appointment 2 weeks ago. Was told I would get a link sent to my email for a video meeting. Clicked link on the day of appointment, waited over an hour. Finally a doctor joined, along with another patient. Doctor said I was given the wrong link and I was suppose to be in with a different doctor and that she would get them to send me the correct link. Office called me and said now the next available would be a week from now since I missed my appointment because of something they did wrong. Would not recommend."
"Heather ""Boo"" Keeling",5,2022,"I have been going to AL Psych & Counseling for many years. I originally saw Dr. Khan and she was precious. I now see Dr. Rabbani and he is great as well. Sandy, the receptionist is awesome and always very helpful and committed to every call that I make. I never feel rushed or ""blown off"". This is a great place. I highly recommend the clinic and Dr. Rabbani. Thank you AL Psych & Counseling for all you do. Thank you Dr. Rabbani for being so caring and diligent."
Misty Haynes,5,2022,"The staff is awesome, from going in to the office prior covid to only communicating over the phone these days. Very pleasant and easy to work with setting up appointments or taking care of refills. Thank you Alabama Psychiatry and Counseling for being great!"
Sam Curtis,5,2022,"Very kind staff that responds quickly to your phone calls. To line up an appointment or refill a prescription, all you need to do is leave a voicemail and within the next hour, I typically get a phone call back to discuss my request."
Arlicia Sims,1,2022,"Horrible. Pill pusher. Uncaring. Unsympathetic. Asked questions concerning my teenage sons therapy, he didn’t like questions. Told me my son was having behavioral issues because I was a rude parent. Condescending. I returned for another appointment and front desk said my son was dropped as a patient by Dr. Rabbani. But I thank him for jumpstarting something I should have done long, long ago and find my son a wonderful engaging psychiatrist. Everyone has their own experience, as I had mine, but there are more NEGATIVE comments here than POSITIVE. Is the majority wrong? Take your kids and run."
Joey Jones,1,2018,"Dr. Khan was the most condescending and rude doctor I have ever had. No bedside manner, never wanted to listen to me, when asked how I was doing one day I said ""fine"" so she said ""ok so you're not depressed"" and she said it as matter of fact as if she were me. This office is all about making money, not helping people. Plus apparently a set appointment means nothing when you have to sit and wait 2 hours past your appointment. And good luck calling them. No matter what you do you will always get a recording. Same goes for trying to fill any of your prescriptions. I can't speak on the other doctors but Dr. Khan is awful. No one should see her."
Jacob Silberman,5,2023,I’ve been coming here for 3 years and everyone here is so patient and understanding. They make me feel welcome and everyone is no nice. I would highly recommend this doctor office to anyone if needed.
Blake Habshey,1,2023,My appointment was cancelled without any notification. They rely solely on an automated system that has failed multiple times. Dr.Robanni never responded to anything.
Peyton H.,1,2020,Asks for a late fee for doctor never getting on video call - plus you can have random patients jumping into video call during scheduled appointment. Staff is extremely rude. Definitely do not recommend.
Veronica Dixon,5,2022,"Dr. Adeel Rabbani has been my psychiatrist for about a year. His wife, Dr. Farah Khan, who passed away last year, was my psychiatrist. After her passing, Dr. Rabbani kindly accepted me as his patient. He is very easy to talk to, and he listens to me. So far, we have stayed with the same plan Dr. Khan had for me, and it is working out fine. The staff at Alabama Psychiatry and Counseling is very kind and accommodating and easy to talk to. I would highly recommend Alabama Psychiatry and Counseling and Dr. Rabbani to anyone seeking help in this area."
James Lovell,5,2018,"I have been seeing Dr. Khan for over a year now. She has helped me through a very tough time in my life along with identifying underlying issues. I remember my very 1st visit, she dropped a medicine I had been taking for many years, which I assume was due to potentially negative drug interactions. No matter the reason, it helped! Dr. Khan is VERY careful and conscious of what medicines she is prescribing you. She will not tolerate being lied to (I had a friend who tried that) and depending on what drug(s) she is prescribing, she will require a drug test if she deems it necessary. If you are wanting a careless psychiatrist, who will write up whatever you ask for, then she is not the one for you. While I am sure she enjoys the money from her profession (whatever is left anyways, from what I would imagine is a hefty college debt), she truly cares about people and her profession. She is a very good listener and I have not felt rushed during my appointments. She is a straight shooter and very blunt, which I personally appreciate. I have not seen the other MD in the office (Dr. Rabbani) but hear great things about him as well. As of this writing they also have a Dr. Whitt (PsyD) and Lynne Kilgore (M.Ed., LPC). The front office staff are very nice and welcoming. They promptly return your calls as well. Oh, I also meant to mention that you can message Dr. Khan (or Dr. Rabbani) regarding any refill request or imminent issues you are having(think bad reaction to meds, not, I need to change my appointment....that's what the front staff is for). For the most part, Dr. Khan has been very responsive, especially considering she has many patients and her own personal life. To give an example, yesterday I messaged her around 1PM (The pharmacy I chose to use was out of my prescribed medicine.), and gave a call to front desk. (They have an option for ""refill request"", you leave a message and they call you back.) The front office called back shortly, gathered needed details, and Dr. Khan had my prescription rerouted to another pharmacy by 5PM. It doesn't always workout like that, but most of the time it does. The waiting room offers a reasonable selection of coffees & teas (caffeinated and decaf) along with REAL coffee mugs, not your typical little Styrofoam cups. I enjoy their location as well. You don't have to worry about parking or traffic. One thing to note: They are currently at 2015 Stonegate Trail Suite 105, but will be moving across the parking lot to a new office around October 2018, with a new address of 2016 Stonegate Trail, Suite 112."
Evan Maltass,5,2021,"This is a beautiful place with a loving and caring staff. I have been going here for over three years now and can honestly say that I would be lost without them. They care about your well-being and strive to get to the source of the problem rather than look for a quick relief. Dr. Khan and Dr. Rabanni have been a blessing to me. Although the loss of Dr. Khan has truly devastated me, I will continue to stay here. If you are in need of help and truly desire change for the better, I strongly recommend Alabama psychiatry and counseling."
Mary Brown,1,2021,"STAY AWAY - I recently moved to the state of Alabama and to continue my adderall prescription, I had to have it prescribed by a psychiatrist. They billed my insurance $1100 for the 5 minute appointment all of which came out of my health savings account. They also charged me $650 for the urine sample that they sent out of state. I could have flown there and hand delivered it myself cheaper. This place is a SCAM. BCBS even got on the phone with them and then asked me to report them to the BBB. They should be ashamed. Coming from someone in healthcare, the front office staff are also quite literally some of the rudest people I have ever met."
John Hay,2,2019,"The doctor we saw was good (Emily Whitt is excellent) so at least 2 stars, but the front office staff, while nice, could not figure out our insurance and we had several visits thinking they were covered and they ended up not being covered. Now we're getting hassled about our balance. Just very frustrating."
Google User,5,2023,I see both Dr Rabbani and Dr Whitt at Alabama Psychiatry and Counseling. They are both very kind and professional. They both make me feel like they really care about my well-being and not like I’m just another patient.
Tara Channel,1,2022,"Whoever writes the responses is mentally disturbed. I did forget my appointment. However,you failed to mention that I was ONLY 10 mins late. If someone else's appointment was about to begin when I logged in then Dr. Rabanni overbooked. Also, what you put in parentheses about me getting ""dressed up"" was uncalled for. I am a Muslim woman and Dr. Rabanni claims to be a Muslim man. I only needed a second to put on my hijab. That should be understood. I was also dealing with an illness which caused me to forget. Dr. Rabanni was absolutely cold and unprofessional. I miss his wife Dr. Khan who had far better manners and way more couth than he. Also,if you weren't present during the call,you don't get to say what happened. You really need a mental check."
olivia21,1,2019,"I would give this place zero stars if possible. I have been seeing a psychiatrist for years and was looking to find another doctor, as my previous psychiatrist is moving. I booked an appointment with Dr. Khan and was very excited after reading the positive google reviews. All I have to say is BE WARY. She began by obviously asking what medications I am prescribed, my emotions, & so forth. However, her demeanor the entire time was a very know-it-all attitude and she did not seem to want or care about my emotions. She critiqued my parents for letting me take Adderall, saying she would only prescribe me XR Adderall. She also let me know she does not practice ""American medicine,"" but believes more in European, mainly Chinese medicine. Her reasoning is because Chinese people have a longer average life span than most Americans. I found this strange as we are in America, but did not let this deter me from continuing to speak with her. She then suggested she could admit me into a hospital to wean me off ALL medications I had been taking for years. When I asked why, she told me it was to see what medications I really needed and how I truly acted without them. I have struggled with depression and anxiety for years, and my mother, a Nurse Practitioner, was in awe once I told her. I think my breaking point occurred when I told her I used to self-harm at a younger age, to which she literally laughed and replied ""how well did that work out for you?"" After this statement, I knew I could never trust her as my caregiver, much less the doctor who looked after my mental health. Dr Khan has absolutely NO bedside manner when it comes to communicating with patients and is very one-sided on all matters. Whenever I asked her a question out of curiosity, she acted like I was interrogating her and seemed annoyed, although I was just trying to get a better understanding of why she did some things the way she does. Overall, the visit was uncomfortable and left me feeling worse about myself than when I came in. While I cannot speak on the other doctors who work with her, I was deterred from ever visiting again after my experience with Dr. Khan. Thankfully, I found a new psychiatrist who truly cares and never suggested or acted out in any of the absurd ways Dr. Khan did. They are now trying to bill me again for a copay I already paid?! They will never receive my service or money again."
Erin Martin,1,2020,"Staff is cold and uncaring in, of all places, a mental health facility. Very difficult to get anyone to answer the phone, so you must leave a message and hope that you get a call back. Dr. Rabbani schedules appointments but does not show up until 15-30 mins after the scheduled time, and then spends 5 minutes total with you. I am highly disappointed in this practice."
Mary Thacker,2,2020,"Just another pill pusher. Went 5 or 6 times. Never got to discuss one problem or issue, just what she wanted to talk about which was always and only my meds. Got to where I had to call in for appts cause they didn't make them right. Finally was having to be worked in every month. Drove 70 miles to go to this doctor, didn't appreciate their lack of efforts doing their job."
Sabrina Rice,1,2020,"This is by far the worst place I ever visited. The office staff is incredibly rude. On my second visit to this office I was told to buy a mask or I had to leave, since I didn't have my own. Was not informed before the appointment is was required I wear a mask, since on my first visit it was not required during covid-19. When I was told I had to wear the mask in the waiting room or leave, I asked why the office staff was not wearing a mask, and was told that it was not up to me to decide what the office staff wears by the very rude receptionist. I will not be back. And will be reporting this facility to the medical board since their medical staff refuses to wear a mask. *edit: Since the mask is for my protection, why was the staff not wearing a mask, the staff that deals with patients all day who could possibly come into contact with the virus? And when ask why they were not wearing a mask, why was I told that it was't up to me to decide if the staff wears a mask? Disgusting."
Tommy Bell,1,2021,Made an appointment hoping to get tested for ADHD. I was told that they do testing and got an appointment with doctor Rabbani. Was then told DURING the consultation that he can't prescribe me medicine without me being tested... That's what I came for. He then said they don't do testing. Huge waste of time. Still charged me 375$ though.
Elizabeth,5,2023,"I would absolutely recommend. Dr. Rabbani is very compassionate and patient health focused. I am always able to get an appointment, and I feel like a priority."
Walt Hunt,1,2023,I prefer my medical professionals don’t dress like they’re making a late night trip to the gas station. Buttons and a collard shirt on a Wednesday afternoon isn’t a wild idea.
Shelby Wharton,2,2022,"It feels like Dr. Rabbani doesn't actually care, he's always 15-20 minutes late, and he asks me if we should up my dosage, isn't he the one who's supposed to know, I'm only 15. I thought it was just me, until I read the other reviews. My mom and I told him that when ever I get in trouble or something that I get thoughts about ending things, and he suggested anger management. It just doesn't make sense."
Ginger Hawkins,1,2021,My son went here to try to get help for his problems. He has been seeing a counselor for a while and wanted to take the next step. The doctor was very condescending towards my son. Told him he’s never had a manic episode or someone would’ve called the ambulance on him. Told him if he’s had a suicidal thought he couldn’t help him and he would just need to be hospitalized. My son was devastated and said he couldn’t even get a word in to tell him what was going on. He was so excited and hopeful for this and now is defeated. I will never understand how people with zero social skills would want to work with mental health. The way they even answer these reviews is unbelievably condescending and rude.
Kirby Willcutt,5,2022,I have always had a great experience. The staff is friendly and Dr. Rabbani is always so helpful too and never have trouble getting in for an appointment.
Anna Baggett,4,2022,"The care here is great. Dr R seems to care and listen thoughtfully to me. I get my meds on time, appointments are easy to make and the service is good."
Kathryn Larson,1,2020,Dr. Khan does indeed lack bedside manner. She lacks empathy. And although I appreciate honesty and her obvious medical knowledge-her responses to me were completely unprofessional and rude. In the moment I thought her dry humor was different and maybe even funny. But I got more and more uncomfortable due to how much she lacked a filter. Her judgment didn’t go unnoticed either.
Ashley Johnson,5,2023,I see Dr.Rabbani currently and he /the office overall are wonderful. They really work hard to help their patients feel seen and heard. I would definitely recommend coming here for treatment.
The Book Of Abby,1,2022,"The receptionist needs a different job, sinces she's rude to everyone and has been given the job of deciding who is a ""right fit"" for the doctor. They DO NOT take Medicare or Medicaid. They DO NOT give diagnosis for disability or the VA."
Dyale Harris,1,2020,This place is not friendly to black ppl but they take there time with whites at the front desk. Dr.Rabbani is not a good person to see because he did not try to get to know me as far as what I was dealing with. The he made the statement that he don't give Xanax or things like that when truth is I don't even take the meds I'm prescribe so why would he think I want xanax. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and I will not be going back there.
DL Seals,1,2020,"Called to make my brother (who has severe depression and social anxiety) an appointment, and the woman who answered the phone was the absolute most unprofessional person I’ve ever encountered. Her first (very ugly) response was “Why can’t he make the appointment himself?” It’s like she’s never dealt with people with a mental illness IN HER LIFE!! There aren’t many people in need of psychiatric care that can do these things themselves without treatment first! But I guess she didn’t know that. Good thing she works for a psychiatrist!!! Then she told me that she wouldn’t even let me make him an appointment without giving her a credit card!! Who do these people treat?! I mean, who could they possibly be helping?? I will be seeking actual PROFESSIONAL help!!"
Sidney Garner,1,2020,Wish I could give 0 stars. Front desk staff very rude. Doctors very uncaring. Recommend you come once a week but then don’t have openings and tell you to call each week to see if anyone cancels. Would recommend you find somewhere more reliable and caring.
Patrick Williams,2,2021,"Canceled my appt. with no warning. They did call me once, but as I was at work (which I had informed them of) and I could not answer. Was unable to get ahold of them calling back 30min later. Received no email text or voicemail informing me of the canceled appointment."
Anthony Gentry,1,2019,"I saw a psychiatrist by the name of Dr. Rabbinni. I have Never had a worse experience with ANY DOCTOR. He sat at his desk typing asking me bullet point questions in rapid succession, without an ounce of compassion, care or even a glance in my direction. I felt like I was in a HORRIBLE job interview where I knew I wasn't going to get the job within the fist 60 seconds. YOU ARE WARNED!!"
Gayle Crause,1,2019,Change their location and changed my appointment and I did not receive notice. Not get informed. Very poor response on the mix up. No email or letter to advise of move. Said they called me to advise of appointment change Unfriendly never apologized. Will not be back.
Wayne Bittner,5,2022,I have been very pleased with my experiences. I’ve never had a billing or insurance problem and the staff is very friendly and accommodating.
Faye,5,2016,"I have been a patient of Dr.Farah Khan's for several years now. She is a very good doctor that listens closely to what you have to say. She may ask a few questions, but she gives me the opportunity to open up and talk to her about things on my mind that may be bothering me. Things that are going on in my life rather it be the past or present. Dr. Khan also answers any and all of my questions. I have seen several psychiatrist doctorts since Dr. LeCroy retired. In my opinion Dr. Khan is one of the best psychiatrist in Jefferson County, Alabama. Dr. Khan's office in Vestavia located in Jefferson County, Alabama is easy to get to and parking is available free and conveient."
Guy Harris,5,2022,"I have been coming to this practice since 2018. The staff have always been helpful, and Dr. Rabbani has become a great asset in my life."
Shea Faulkner,1,2021,"I've been seeing a psychiatrist there for about 2 years now. I tried to see a therapist there about a year ago and all she talked about was how I should exercise. I didn't return to see her. Now, I had a telehealth appointment scheduled for last Friday and no one ever called me to confirm, etc. I called and let them know Friday afternoon. I get a call this morning (Monday) stating that there's a no show fee on the account. I argued with the receptionist and she proceeded to give me a whole list of reasons why she couldn't remove the fee. Their billing was in another state, the Dr. would have to agree to remove the fee, etc. I've also had to pay my entire deductible for the year before being seen before. This place is all about money and nothing about care or patients. I will not be going back and will never recommend them. *EDIT for Clarification* My appointment was confirmed for 10/23/2020 at 10:00AM. I never received a phone call or message asking me to join the Telehealth appointment on 10/23/2020. However, when I called to inquire about this, I was told that someone had called me several times that day about the appointment. I went onto my cell provider website and pulled my call logs from that day and there were zero incoming calls from your business on that day. I also emailed this information to you as well as to let you know I will not be paying the no show fee. I have attached this call log highlighting where I called the office on 10/23/2020 to ask why I had never received any notification about the appointment. I had to leave a voicemail. The other highlight on 10/26/2020 is where the office called me back and stated the above about the multiple attempted calls and no show fee. *Second Edit* Now they have proceeded to send me a paper bill via mail for the no show fee. I have attached a screenshot of the bill. This is unbelievable. Please do not waste your time or money on this pathetic excuse for a business."
Hayden H,4,2022,I saw Dr Khan for years before moving to Dr Rabbani a few years ago. I have had overall good experiences with the maintaining of my medicine.
Justyn Lamb Millar,5,2022,Dr. Rabbani is an excellent psychiatrist. He is empathetic and knowledgeable. He is honest and provides great care. Highly recommend.
Eric Dale,1,2023,I agree with all the other reviews. This place is horrible. I felt worse just trying to deal with them. No one answers the phone. I showed up for my appointment and the doors were locked.
BaileyJ 239,1,2022,I’d give a 0 if I could. They never answer the phone so it’s impossible to make your next appointment. I loved Dr.Chowdhurry but was too frustrated with the incompetence of the staff.
Kadarryl Simmons,1,2023,They charged me a $50 no show fee but would not answer the phone when I called in to reschedule
Leigh Anne Hall,5,2022,"This is a great place. If you are looking for a personal touch instead of just another location of a huge practice, this is it. I can't say enough good things about Dr. Whitt and Dr. Rabbani."
Desiree Riley,5,2022,I've been a patient for years and this office has helped me through any issues I have had. Great team!
John Thomas,1,2019,I will never use them again. Very questionable billing practices. Rude and unhelpful with billing questions. Unprofessional front staff. Was charged $200 for an office visit the front staff mistakenly made.
Madison Schuelly (Maddie),1,2020,Terrible! I paid my 25$ copay to see the doctor on time and he never got on the zoom call. Then got 100$ late fee in the mail!!!!
Aaron Moore,5,2022,Dr. Rabbani has always been very professional and works with me to ensure I am taken care of properly.
Allison B.,1,2017,"Appt w/ Dr. Rabbani was a total waste of time. Wanted to treat a problem that was not the underlying issue, instead of the issue at hand. Do not waste your $ or time."

Kaytlin Taylor,1,2021,"Got ghosted by my therapist here. Kept scheduling appointments and by the time they would come, the lady said there was nothing written down for me. I don’t recommend getting treatment here. Very judgmental counselors and psychiatrists who do not listen to your needs."
J Dobelstein,5,2022,"Kind and helpful staff who always returns phone calls quickly, is quick to help accommodate needs, and prioritizes patients."
Hunter Haferkamp (US),5,2023,Dr. Adeel Rabbani is great! He works great to address my individual needs

Rodney Gillespie,5,2024,"I was a train wreck just a few short years ago and now people around me can see a difference ,But most of all I can see a big difference"
Dee Dee,1,2019,The doctors are racist and only see patients that are relatives of the doctors. Doctors are slow and rude as well as the front staff. I am considering filing a lawsuit for discrimination
