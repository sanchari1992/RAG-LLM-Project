Garrett Anderson,3,2024,I have ben waiting 3 months to see a doctor for meds and I'm still in the wait list. My counselor left before my grace period was up and I was marked a no show and was charged for it. Overall I'm disappointed I had such high hopes for this company I thought they really had something special at first.
Starla Karns,2,2024,"At first I would have gave 5 stars, blindly picked to get in sooner than elsewhere. Now I believe in spiritual life, and God.I tried talking to the counselor, she made few statements and let it go, but when she brought it up again I got upset. I was there to talk about my past issues. I was not expecting her to push me to go NA meetings and engagement with letting go and let God.. I wanted to focus on my past abuse that happend to me not a 13yrs I'm in recovery to start going to NA again. Now if she would have talked about my actual trama I would still be there. I asked for new counselor, and apparently everyone of the staff does ""faith based"" counseling, proceed to ask if I wanted to go across a state line to get someone else... might I add it is all zoom, and even though the website says 8am-9pm services mon-fri mine conveniently didn't. So now I've gone elsewhere and stated what had happened, and this is ridiculous there is no reason if someone is not interested in implementing your beliefs don't push them on others it just makes people upset!"
