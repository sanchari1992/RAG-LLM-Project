For example, it's green when it's in normal range, yellow with it's a little above normal range, and red when it's dangerously high.

"iHealth Track Smart Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor with Wide Range Cuff That fits Standard to Large Adult Arms, Bluetooth Compatible for iOS & Android Devices",5.0,Easy to Use,"I'm very pleased with this purchase. To begin, I figured it would be more expensive to buy a blood pressure cuff alone. This is relatively inexpensive and worth every penny. I have absolutely no experience taking blood pressure and was surprised at how easy it is with this. The direction are clear and concise. The cuff is marked so you know what to line up with your middle finger (be sure to read the directions as my description is very abbreviated). The digital readout is larger making it easy to see and has additional color coding (the entire screen goes green, orange or red) that goes along with your blood pressure depending on how good or bad it is. It takes four AAA batteries. And it connects to your phone. I haven't used used this feature yet. Definitely a good purchase if you're trying to keep tabs on your blood pressure but have no experience doing it the old fashion way.","Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2024"

"iHealth Track Smart Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor with Wide Range Cuff That fits Standard to Large Adult Arms, Bluetooth Compatible for iOS & Android Devices",5.0,Incorrect readings- NO LONGER,"love fact that monitor has blue tooth and able to track and sync with the IHealth app---however after a 2 week of extreme high readings 190+ constantly, both arms, it was running almost 30+ points higher than taken with doctors cuff by both the nurse and dr. This model constantly put me in high hypertension zone... DR recommend the OMRON brand as that is his home use cuff.
Sadly I would send back if not used so often.
I am adjusting, or correcting my review. IHealth reached out to me and provide a larger cuff which they responded that could be the issue with my readings. Their customer service super informative and provided constructive feedback they sent me a new cuff and monitor and i have not taken 3 readings since getting the new cuff and readings are now within what I would expect.

Its portability means you can easily take it on the go, making it ideal for travelers or those who frequently need to monitor their blood pressure throughout the day.

"iHealth Neo Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor, Upper Arm Cuff, Bluetooth Blood Pressure Machine, Ultra-Thin & Portable, App-Enabled for iOS & Android",5.0,I Love This Thing,"Apparently, I'm at the age where I'm excited about a blood pressure monitor; sigh. But seriously, this thing is great. I've had high blood pressure at doctor visits for the last year or two. Not enough for them to give me medication, but enough to bring it to my attention. I bought this to be proactive and to try to identify patterns about when it's high and why, and also so I can monitor it as I make lifestyle changes to try to lower it.

I almost bought the other iHealth model that has the separate base because I liked the screen, but I ultimately decided on this one, primarily because I loathe disposable batteries and I liked that this model is rechargeable. I'm really glad I chose this one, it's so convenient and portable! I didn't think I'd care about that since I use it mostly at home, but it's super compact and easy to keep anywhere without having some bulky contraption hanging around to look obnoxious.

I chose the iHealth brand because I liked the idea of the app. You can use the app on your phone but it also automatically uploads to their cloud interface so you can sign on from a PC to view charts, etc. I will say the charts are less than ideal and could be better, but they're okay. You can email them to yourself or others (like a doctor) via PDF and other formats, which is nice.

The thing I like most about the app is having the start button on the phone. I like that I can start it that way instead of using the button on the unit so that I can sit quietly for a moment before I begin without reaching over to press the button. It's a minor detail, but handy. You can also skip the app entirely if you prefer and the unit works without it.

Setup was extremely easy. I find it to be accurate, at least as far as I can tell. My very first reading was almost identical to the reading my doctor got only 4 days earlier.

It connects to Bluetooth automatically as soon as I open the app, and it also automatically uploads each reading to the cloud interface. It even shuts itself off and disconnects when I'm done so I do nothing except hit the start button, it couldn't be easier.

I like this so much that I came back to Amazon and ordered an iHealth scale as well, so I can monitor my weight loss, which is one of the lifestyle changes I'm making to lower my blood pressure. That will upload to the same interface so I can see everything in one place. I feel more in charge of my health with these units and I really like the ability to track my progress in the app.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024"
"iHealth Neo Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor, Upper Arm Cuff, Bluetooth Blood Pressure Machine, Ultra-Thin & Portable, App-Enabled for iOS & Android",5.0,So happy to finally go cordless!,"I have high BP and have been advised to monitor regularly by my providers. I love the ihealth platform because I links directly to my Google fit as well as my EMR app, so they have direct access to my readings. I bought an older unit from ihealth several years ago and didn't care for it, then I lost it and didn't bother to search for it. I'm super happy with this unit because it completely eliminated the long air hose, as well as the separate inflator pump. No more fighting to line it up properly with that out of the way! Everything is right there on the cuff and it's very easy to put on. It also fits easily into my purse when zipped into it's pouch (included!) Connection to my phone and the app were seamless and readings are just like before. The only thing I would change would be the outdated micro USB charge port. Please make it universal with a USB-C, or wireless charging capability! Overall I am very happy with this upgrade.

And for those wondering, it will work without your phone when you don't have it available. There's a start button and a display on the cuff that will give your reading, which is another improvement over my old unit that only worked with my phone.","Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2024"
