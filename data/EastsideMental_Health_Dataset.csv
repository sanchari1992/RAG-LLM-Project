Siame7474,1,2024,Poorly run clinic that used to be great. There is a high turnover of doctors who left for better pay. Now they have hired nurse practitioner who doesn't understand mental health disorders who prescribed meds without worries of interactions. The therapist is a narcissist who could careless if you are helped but too concerned about watching the clock and lunchtime. Please consider another clinic the patient retention is horrible and people are leaving just like the doctors.
mike ensley,5,2023,"Great people that actually seem to care, listen to you and value you which are some of the things anyone dealing with emotional or mental disorders need the most. Thanks to Dr. Yulia Spencer I was able to not only find the medications I needed at the time but eventually progress to where they were no longer needed. Best psychiatric experience I had any where."
Carla Clayton,2,2022,"My therapist had to reschedule my appointment for today at 1:00. I was there at 5 til, stepped out of the office for 2 minutes at 10 after, then waited til 1:20 before she finally called me back. She claimed she came to the lobby looking for me at 1 which is a lie. Then she couldn't seem to understand why I was irritated. She suggested that we reschedule our appointment for another time which I agreed to. Someone has an attitude"
Jerrilyn Conlon,1,2023,If could go lower I would. People say that mental health is an issue today yet the people in charge of helping don't seem to care. I don't know if the nurses don't want to do their job or have an issue with mental health.
Cassandra Moore,5,2023,Neal Tillman was the best therapist I could talk to and really cared about you as a patient. Liked him drawing the smiley face on the next appointment pad

Football is King,1,2024,More than poor. They donâ€™t recognize depression as a mental illness worth therapy. Disgusting people
